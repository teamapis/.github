# Welcome to TEAM APIs!

> Disclaimer: This organization and its repositories should not be considered official in any way. Official resources and documentation for Atlassian API usage is located at the [Atlassian Developer](https://developer.atlassian.com/) website.

The primary goal of this collection of repositories is to provide a record of externally visible changes to Atlassian Cloud API schemas.

Along the way, we may provide alternative schemas to the official ones which address quirks we've found in the official schemas.

Star the repository of the APIs you use most often, or [follow us on Twitter](https://twitter.com/TeamApis)!
